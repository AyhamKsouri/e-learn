# ðŸŽ“ Student Experience Features

## âœ¨ What We've Built

### 1. **Authentication & User Context**
- **UserContext**: Manages user authentication state across the app
- **Persistent Login**: Users stay logged in across page refreshes
- **Role-based Access**: Different experiences for students, teachers, and admins

### 2. **Smart Navigation**
- **Before Login**: Shows "Sign In" and "Get Started" buttons
- **After Login**: Shows personalized student profile dropdown
- **Conditional Rendering**: Automatically switches based on auth status

### 3. **Student Profile Dropdown**
- **Personalized Header**: Shows student name, email, and role
- **Quick Stats**: Enrolled courses, completed courses, average progress
- **Smart Navigation**: Direct links to student-specific features
- **Profile Management**: Settings and logout options

### 4. **Personalized Home Page**
- **Student Welcome Section**: Only shows for logged-in students
- **Progress Dashboard**: Visual stats and quick actions
- **Smart CTAs**: "Continue Learning" and "View My Courses" buttons

### 5. **Internationalization**
- **English & French**: All new features support both languages
- **Consistent Translations**: Matches existing site language system
- **Dynamic Content**: User names and stats display in user's language

## ðŸš€ How It Works

### **Authentication Flow**
1. User signs up/logs in through `/auth`
2. Backend returns user data + JWT token
3. Token stored in localStorage
4. User data stored in UserContext
5. Navigation automatically updates
6. User redirected to role-appropriate dashboard

### **State Management**
- **UserContext**: Central source of truth for user data
- **Local Storage**: Persists authentication across sessions
- **Automatic Updates**: UI reacts to auth state changes

### **Role-based Routing**
- **Students**: Redirected to `/dashboard/student`
- **Teachers**: Redirected to `/dashboard/teacher`
- **Admins**: Redirected to `/dashboard/admin`
